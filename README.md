  - `display` - `0` for Liquid Crystal Display and `1` for OLED Display
  - `display_address` - I2C display address
2. Install PlatformIO and flash NodeMCU
  - `pip install -U platformio`
  - `platformio update`
  - `platformio run --target upload`
3. Power the device and wait 20 Seconds until access point is shown on the display
4. Connect to it and open the shown address in your browser
5. Apply configurations as shown in the web ui
